  "description": "An adversary able to create a Lambda Function with any role and give themselves the permissions to invoke it would be able to escalate their permissions by attaching a privileged role to the function while defining the Lambda's actions. As such, they would obtain the ability to perform actions using the permissions of the attached role, allowing further enumeration and exploitation of the environment.",

  "recommendation": "Remediation steps:\n 1. Sign in to AWS Console\n 2.Navigate to the EC2 instance or Lambda Function, and either replace the role for a less privileged one, or remove it entirely. If the role is not in use by any other entities, you could simply remove the role's excessive permissions.",
