  "description": "An adversary able to create CloudFormation stacks with any role would be able to escalate their permissions by attaching a privileged role to the stack while influencing the actions taken by the created resources. As such, they would obtain the ability to perform actions using the permissions of the attached role, allowing further enumeration and exploitation of the environment.",
