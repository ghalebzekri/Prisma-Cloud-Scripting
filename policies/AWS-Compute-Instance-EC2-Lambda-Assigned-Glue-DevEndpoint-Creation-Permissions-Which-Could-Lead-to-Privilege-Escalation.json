  "description": "An adversary able to create a Glue DevEndpoint with any role would be able to escalate their permissions by attaching a privileged role to the endpoint and configuring authentication to the endpoint using a key which they control. As such, they would obtain the ability to perform actions using the permissions of the attached role, allowing further enumeration and exploitation of the environment.",
